Hello and welcome to me trying to convince my professor that I know how to do simple python commands. Can I do it folks? I'm honestly not sure but I'm going to give it the last good ol' college try. Prepare for the lines of code that will make you want to click out. #cringe :)))))


```{python}
#this is a python code chunk
line="brevity is the soul of wit"
by="w.shakespeare"
```


```{R}
library(reticulate)
#this is an r code chunk 
py$line
py$by
```
